# Enhancement Ideas

Below is a list of potential enhancement ideas that could be made to this game.

## Multiple maps

Right now this game only contains one small map. I think the game having multiple map that the player
can travel between would make this game a lot more interesting and fun.

## Items and Inventory

Games of this genre typically have an inventory system that allows for the player to pick up and hold on to items, and use them in some shape or form later on in the game.
For example, the cat's ball could be an item placed in the player's inventory after finding it. Collectibles could also be fun to add around maps to encourage the player to explore.

## Story

As interesting as a cat losing its ball is, this story can definitely be expanded on to be more engaging and make the player want to keep playing
so they can experience more of it. Adding in more "tasks", more NPCs, etc. would also help to add to the overall story by making the world feel more immersive.

## More to gameplay

In its current state, this game is walking and talking simulator. Most games of this genre have an additional element to make the gameplay more engaging.
This often involves the inclusion of enemies or some kind of battle system, with either overworld combat (like The [Legend of Zelda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGtMqO7_DKY)) or a separate battle system (like [Pok√©mon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpdy9pZyGH4)).
Often games also have overworld movement challenges, such as needing to navigate through a dungeon or having to solve a puzzle.
This game engine has a lot of flexibility in the direction it gets taken in, but any additional gameplay elements would greatly increase this game's engagement and fun factor.

## Game music/sounds

There is no music/sounds in this game! Music and sound support could be added to specific classes, or even
be added to the actual game engine itself so every class in the game can use them in a convenient manner.

# More Set Pieces

The game could use more variety, from map tile graphics to NPC scripts to map design.
It would make the game a lot more interesting to look at and traverse through.
